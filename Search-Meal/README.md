## Web Programming Final Project
Using either a static JSON API or a free API, like rapidapi.com, develop a React front end that will allow the user to view and filter the data from your previously created report. It could be an app that mixes more than one api. For example, It uses a map api and a restaurant finder. It should react to user input in some way to change a react component Make different GET requests based on user input.

Skills to demonstrate: React, Components + JSX, Hooks, React Router

## Meal Search App
This is a simple React JS Search Web application that illustrates how to perform a search and how many times you clicked on it. In this application, I query one of the [themealdb.com](https://www.themealdb.com/) APIs (Free API) that returns a series of images for the meals that you are looking for.
